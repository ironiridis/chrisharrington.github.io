Well it has been a bit. Like most professional blogs, this fell disused while I was focused on my "real job".

In the mean time, though, I am happy to share that I've been certified as both an [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aw.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/verification.aspx?code=026THM1K4MV11GS8) and an [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional](https://aw.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/verification.aspx?code=0H7WWYWC9BFEQZ3N). I'm continuing to work on building skills, and I'm taking the exam to become an _AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate_ today. We'll see how that goes. (**Update**: It went well! I'm now also an [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aw.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/verification.aspx?code=0GL7T5G1WNR11S96).)

One thing I took away from the DevOps Engineer certification exam is that I do not know nearly enough about the AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy products. So as a personal project, I'm thinking I'll propose a CodePipeline process at work, to wean us away from our current CI/CD vendor. Could be fun, and I hope to learn from the process.
